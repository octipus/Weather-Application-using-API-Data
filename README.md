# Weather Application based on API Data - Task 2

This project is part of the final mark assignment for Web Data using XML and JSON module - Birkbeck university 2018.

[Project URL](http://titan.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~oconti01/wd/fma/task2/apiweather.html) 


## The API

To build the UK weather application for this part of the FMA, you will use
the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/). To use this `API` you will first need to register
and get yourself an `API` key. There are detailed instructions on the
OpenWeatherMap API help page on how to work with the `API` (e.g. how to
create a request URL).

## The Application

The application should work as follows. Users should be able to choose a
UK country (England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland) from a menu
on a HTML page.

Depending on which country the user chooses,
corresponding city name data for the chosen country should be
dynamically loaded into a second menu.The user should then be able to
select a city name from the second menu. Upon selection, the weather for
the selected city should be retrieved from the `API`, and displayed as
HTML.

UK city data for the menus is provided in the FMA resources folder in
Moodle.
The following weather data items should be displayed for a selected city:

| No.| Data        |
| -------- |:------|
| 1| Ciy name |
| 2| Date      |
| 3| Weather conditions     |    
| 4| Temperature |
| 5| Wind speed      |
| 6| Wind direction     |
| 6| Weather icon     |

The following display requirements should apply:
1. Temperature must be displayed in Celsius.
2. Wind speed must be displayed in miles-per-hour.
3.  Wind direction must be displayed as a textual description
(Acceptable output would be Southerly, South Westerly, Westerly,
North Westerly, Northerly, North Easterly, Easterly, South Easterly).
4. The date must be displayed in standard date format (e.g. 2-10-
2015).


**Presentation of the application must be to professional standard.**
